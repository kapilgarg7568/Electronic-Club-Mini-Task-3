# Control System for Hexapod
## Data from multiple IMU to microcontroller
 **Sensor**:
 - Here I am using **MPU-6050** sensor based on MEMS (micro electro mechanical systems) technology.
 - MPU6050 sensor module is complete 6-axis Motion Tracking Device. It combines 3-axis Gyroscope, 3-axis Accelerometer and Digital Motion Processor all in small package.
 - it has additional feature of on-chip Temperature sensor. 
 - It has I2C bus interface to communicate with the microcontrollers.

 **Microcontroller**:
 - Here i have choosen **Arduino UNO board** as our microcontroller as it is easy to use and cheap.
 - It supports I2C protocol hence its is compatible with our MPU-6050 sensor.
