# MicroMouse Maze
**Problem Statement**: To make a fully autonomous bot which can solve the maze without hotting the wall.

## Required Components
**Square shape board of Plastic for Chassis**:Easily available and can be drilled easily.

**2 DC motors with encoders and wheels:** I think should do the job for us as the encoder will detect the speed of motor, direction of rotation, distance it hs travelled and its feedback data enables us to control motor speed and direction efficiently.

**Castor ball wheel**

**Ultrasonic HC-SR04 rangefinder**:We need 3 HC-SR04 sensors for this project one in the front and two on the the sides. It provides 2 to 400 cm non contact measurement with a ranging accuracy of 3mm. It is easy to set up and has additional control circuitry that can prevent inconsistent bouncy data.

**Small piece of Breadbord**: As it will be handy for us to make connection of three ultrasonic sensor, dc motor to Arduino.

**Arduino UNO**:Its easy to use and much cheaper in compared to Arduino Nano and ESP32. It's not that big in size and fulfil our requirement for this projecet.

**Arduino Motor Shield**:Its based on L298 and can be used to drive two DC with Arduino board, controlling the speed and direction of each one independently.
